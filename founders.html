<strong><font size="6.5" span style="color:#700000">Thomas Prislac</font><br>
&nbsp &nbsp The creative repertoire of composer and vocalist Thomas Prislac Jr. is as celebrated as it is varied. 
Having performed with Portland Opera and being broadcast across the world on Allclassical 89.9, 
Thomas quickly realized his dream of singing professionally. His belief in the importance of arts 
education has also motivated him to participate in outreach programs that have taken him across the 
Pacific Northwest, Western Europe and into Central Mexico to sing and teach children of all ages about the importance of 
arts appreciation. In addition to traveling the world to share music, Mr. Prislac has reached millions of 
listeners through his YouTube channel where he posts a collection of ambient compositions. He is a signed 
artist with CDBaby, having his work distributed for purchase through iTunes, Spotify, and countless other 
online outlets.
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp In addition to composition and performance Thomas Prislac Jr. has also taken up the mantel of Arts Administration. 
Managing and creating content for multiple online fundraising campaigns, he has helped produce works such as 
Ethan Gans-Morse's opera <i>The Canticle of the Black Madonna.</i> This gripping opera, composed to raise awareness about 
PTSD in the Veterans community, had its world premiere in Portland's Newmark Theatre. Thomas is also actively engaged 
with local organizations as well as promoting his own company PDXVT Productions. </strong></p></th>

<strong><font size="6.5" span style="color:#700000">Benjamin Engen</font><br>
&nbsp &nbsp Ben Engen is a percussionist from the Rogue Valley, Oregon.  While studying for his undergraduate degree
 in percussion performance at Southern Oregon University, he was in charge of digitally converting 
 classroom lesson plans into downloadable formats to be made available on professor's BBS websites. 
 This introduced Ben to his first recording system based around a MOTU 828 mki hardware interface.
 <br> 
 &nbsp &nbsp Later, after graduating from SOU he played for the Seattle-based dual-genre group Stabbingback. 
 There he had the opportunity to perform live and miked up in various environments, such as an a
 bandoned building, a cafeteria, and a recording studio. Later he joined a local Eugene Blues band 
 named "The Corporate Hillbillies", which utilized both his engineering and drumming at Down Valley 
 Studios. For about two years Corporate Hillbillies played various gigs in Eugene but eventually parted 
 ways when Ben moved to Portland.  Having lived the past three years in the area, Ben has honed his 
 audio knowledge engineering and assisting on projects at Fern Valley Studios, teaching recording 
 basics at Guitar Center's Music Mentor series and recording drums at his home in Northeast Portland.</strong></p></th></tr>
